                <p class="whitefont">For my high school senior year capstone project, three other classmates and I decided to collaborate to create a new and improved database of clients for the Bergen County Division of Veterans' Affairs and Services. Previously, the director of Veterans' Services, AJ Luna, used paper files to keep track of all of his clients because his digital database was both unfunctionable and inefficient. Our database introduced new features, such as filtering clients with a search bar, exporting the list of clients to Microsoft Excel, along with adding a log-in screen to only allow certain individuals to access the confidential information. In addition to this, the databases' design was changed to look nicer and be more organized. </p>

                <p class="whitefont">In Fall 2019, I took Professor Policastro's DS-UA-112 course. The language we used in this course was Python: more specifically, we utilized the NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib libraries. The first project of the semester was to analyze the last 3,000 of President Trump's Tweets and make an analysis based on it. I chose to analyze the average sentiment of each tweet based on length of post. For the second project of the semester, we had to create an accurate classifier model to distinguish spam emails from ham emails. I chose to create a Logistic Regression  model by removing HTML tags inside of texts. My models' accuracy was approximately 90% while precision and recall were 63% and 81% respectively. </p>
